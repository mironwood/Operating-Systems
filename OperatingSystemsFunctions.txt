My favorite function of an operating system is the user interface it provides. I think user interfaces are fascinating and beautiful, specifically graphical user interfaces. I aspire to be a UI designer. I think that a well designed UI can make or break an operating system or piece of software.
Another function certainly worthy of mention is the ability to power on and off a decvice. I typically run my devices as an 'always on' kind of user but understand that there are pros and cons to leaving my devices on constantly. Either way I am greatful that the proces is made easier by having the operating system manage the function.
