My favorite function of an operating system is the user interface it provides. I think user interfaces are fascinating and beautiful, specifically graphical user interfaces. I aspire to be a UI designer. I think that a well designed UI can make or break an operating system or piece of software.
Another function certainly worthy of mention is the ability to power on and off a device. I typically run my devices as an 'always on' kind of user but understand that there are pros and cons to leaving my devices on constantly. Either way I am grateful that the process is made easier by having the operating system manage the function.
Because I have been primarily a mobile user for the last decade, the ability for my device to multitask is extremely important to me. The management of programs is another function of the operating system. I am so grateful that my phone is able to multitask so efficiently. Sometimes I am literally transferring information from one app to another and if I was unable to run them 'side-by-side' it would be so much more difficult. This is something iOS specifically has always been very good at in my opinion.
